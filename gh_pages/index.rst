Tesseract Igntion Tools
-----------------------

* **tesseract-setup-wizard** – This is a developers tool for the Tesseract Motion Planning Library. It allows the developer to define allowed collision matrix, manipulator groups, saved states, tool center points and opw kinematics.
* **tesseract-visualization** – This is a developers tool for visualization of Tesseract components. Currently this is very basic but allows the developer to visualize the scene, trajectories, cartesian poses without using ROS. This was essential because Tesseract is ROS Agnostic.
